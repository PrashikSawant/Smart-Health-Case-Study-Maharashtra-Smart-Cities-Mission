# Smart Health Case Study - Maharashtra (Smart Cities Mission)

## Project Overview
This repository contains the full documentation, analysis, and output files for a data-driven case study conducted under the **MentorMind Menternship Program**, in collaboration with **CIE at IIIT Hyderabad**. The project is based on the **Smart Cities Mission of the Government of India** and focuses on analyzing the health care infrastructure of **Maharashtra** using real datasets from the **Open Smart Cities Data Portal**.

## Objective
To identify systemic inefficiencies in the supply, distribution, and usage of essential healthcare commodities in Maharashtra and to propose scalable, smart solutions to improve healthcare delivery using data analytics, AI, and IoT.

## Certificate ID
**MM-20203** (Issued by MentorMind in association with CIE at IIIT Hyderabad)

## Key Contributions
- Collected and analyzed datasets on healthcare resource allocation and usage across urban and rural Maharashtra
- Identified data gaps, rural-urban disparities, and stock mismanagement using Excel and Power BI
- Designed smart solutions such as:
  - Digital Health Supply Dashboards
  - AI-based Stock Prediction Models
  - IoT-enabled Transport Monitoring
  - Public-Private Health Delivery Partnerships
  - Mobile Health Distribution Units
- Developed a professional case study document and research report supported with data visualizations

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Excel** for data cleaning and visualization
- **Python (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn)** for analysis and model prototyping
- **Power BI / Tableau** for visual insights (optional)
- **Canva / MS PowerPoint** for case study design and report formatting
